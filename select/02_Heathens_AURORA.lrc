[00:07.47] She bargains with the world
[00:10.35] So everything she wants will come to her
[00:14.81] With no greed inside her mind
[00:18.24] She knows what she deserves
[00:31.74] 
[00:22.54] We fell from sky with grace
[00:26.07] And landed in her soft and warm embrace
[00:30.49] She gave her love, her gift of life
[00:34.18] So we could live with her
[00:46.68] 
[00:37.51] That is why we live like heathens
[00:41.60] Stealing from the trees of Eden
[00:45.16] Living in the arms of freedom
[00:49.04] And everything we touch is evil
[00:53.09] That is why we live like heathens
[01:09.59] 
[01:01.20] The stone, the dirt, the dust
[01:03.84] The unforgiving promise made to us
[01:07.91] Unworthy of your light, your god, your touch
[01:11.97] We're guided by the lust
[01:23.97] 
[01:16.89] We cry the fallen names
[01:19.78] We cry for those who burn beneath the flame
[01:23.80] We stand besides the good and brave
[01:27.74] The broken and enslaved
[01:39.24] 
[01:31.30] That is why we live like heathens
[01:35.12] Stealing from the trees of Eden
[01:38.69] Living in the arms of freedom
[01:42.42] And everything we touch is evil
[01:46.82] That is why we live like heathens
[02:03.32] 
[02:09.11] Everything you touch will be hers
[02:17.63] A mother with no heart will give love
[02:36.13] 
[02:35.46] Her love is yours, but only if you give your heart to her
[03:03.96] 
[03:04.20] That is why we live like heathens
[03:07.83] Stealing from the trees of Eden
[03:11.63] Living in the arms of freedom
[03:15.56] And everything we touch is evil
[03:19.62] That is why we live like heathens
[03:36.12] 
[03:28.06] That is why we live like heathens
[03:35.80] That is why we live like heathens
